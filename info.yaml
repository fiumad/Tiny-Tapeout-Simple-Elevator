# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Dan Fiumara"      # Your name
  title:        "Simple Elevator Circuit"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "This circuit represents a four floor elevator via two LEDs."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The input switch determines whether the elevator will move up or down a floor. The input button will make the change defined by the switch.
      
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
       The two LEDs are the current floor number in binary. If both LEDs are off, flip the switch to high and press the button a few times. If both LEDs are on, flip the
       switch to low and press the button a few times. The button will need to be debounced.
